## What?
Technically a screen sleeper. For the love of Mother Earth. 

## How?
In Windows, it uses [Win32 API's](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ff818516(v=vs.85).aspx) [`SendMessage()`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms644950(v=vs.85).aspx).

For Linux though, magic is yet to be discovered. Help will be well appreciated in this matter.

## Tips for best experience

- Pin the app to your taskbar for easy click or `[WINDOWS KEY] + [NUMBER]` [combinations](http://winsupersite.com/faqtip/access-taskbar-keyboard-shortcuts).
- Assigning a designated hotkey for the app eases its use as well.

## Timeline
